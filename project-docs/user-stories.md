Non-carryover budgets are consumption limits.
Carryover budgets are contribution goals.

As a user I would open my app for:
 - Viewing my balance for a category to know how much to spend
 - Manually documenting a transaction while in a store
 - Month's end
 - Creating a budget

As a user:
 - Have easy access to manage my Accounts, Categories, Transactions, Budget
 - Add/Edit/Remove a new account
 - Add/Edit/Remove a new category
 - Associate a category to an account
 - View my accounts balance for the current month
 - View my accounts balance for a selected month
 - View my available funds for a category
 - Log an expense of a category from my main account
 - Log an expense from my savings account
 - Log an income into my main account
 - Log a funding of a category from main account to savings account
 - Upload my bank statement and auto-populate expenses by category. Prompt user for un-identified expenses
 - Same as above for my credit card statements
